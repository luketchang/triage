I just migrated from nats server to rabbitmq (may have introduced bug) but getting some "No matching document found", duplicate key errors, and validation errors in some services around 2025-05-02T02:30:00.00Z. Figure out the root cause of the issue and propose a concrete code fix. Do not stop exploring code or logs until you have a concrete fix in code.
